            <strong>A line break</strong> is a way to seperate paragraph boxes visually.
            Use cases are for formatting texts like addresses or poems <br>
            you don't want to use it
            in lieu of seperating paragraphs.
            So if you want to get to the <br>
            next line in your paragraph<br>
            use the <em>line break</em> or "< br >"
            Notice we are only using an open  < br > because it is a self-closing tag.<br>
            some self-closing tags are: < input >, < img >, < br >, < hr >. <br>
        </p>
                    <hr>
        <p style="font-size: x-large"> And the next element is Horizontal Rule which is a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. </p>
                    <hr>
            <img src="color-attribute.webp" height="600" width="750" alt="BROKEN">
                    <hr>
        <p style="font-size: x-large">
    <em>
        THIS IS ALL EMPHASIS, TYPED AS ITALICIZED
    </em>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large">
            <strong>
                 THIS IS ALL STRONG, TYPED 'BOLD'
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large">
            These are both <strong>inline elements:</strong><br>
            <strong>W3 Schools:</strong> 'An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.'
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large">
            <strong>W3 Schools: </strong><em>'A block-level element</em> always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
            A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)'.
